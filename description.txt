Hook Stats and Wing Stats is a mod that does exactly what it sounds like, adds tooltips to hooks and wings that detail their stats. This mod supports both modded and vanilla hooks and wings.


Currently supported mods:
- Calamity + addons (this mod disables vanilla and Calamity stats as Calamity shows its own and isn’t configurable)
- Clicker Class
- Consolaria
- Echoes of the Ancients
- Fargo's Souls Mod
- Orchid
- Secrets of the Shadows
- tModLoader
- Vitality Mod
