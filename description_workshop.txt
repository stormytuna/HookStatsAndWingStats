Hook Stats and Wing Stats is a mod that does exactly what it sounds like, adds tooltips to hooks and wings that detail their stats. This mod supports both modded and vanilla hooks and wings. As well as displaying a highlighted items stats, you can display a comparison to your equipped items stats, with better and worse stats being highlighted. This mod is also highly configurable and nothing requires a reload, so feel free to mess with stuff in game.
